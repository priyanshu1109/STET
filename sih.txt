1.  Our portal will receive only digilocker documents as documents received from digilocker are treated as verified.
    Other than that no other documents are acceptable.

2.  Using text recognition our portal also verifies that document uploaded will belongs to that particular candidate or not
    by matching the credentials in document with the credentials given by the user.

3.  Our portal is going to provide the payment gateway which will reduce the manual intervention upto the great extent as now
    they have only option of e-challan for payments.

4.  Our portal is also capable of generating admit card automatically which will reduces the chances of human error.

5.  Candidates are informed about each notifications through email and messages.

    will make the results and release it on the portal and also send the messages to the candidates.
